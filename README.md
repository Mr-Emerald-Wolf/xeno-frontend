# Mini CRM & Campaign Management App - Frontend

This is the frontend for the Mini CRM & Campaign Management App built with the T3 stack (Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma). It interacts with the backend APIs to load customer data, manage audience segments, send campaign messages, and more.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Google login via NextAuth.js
- **Audience Segments**: Create and manage customer audience segments based on various filters.
- **Campaign History & Stats**: View previous campaigns, stats, and performance.
- **Message Sending**: Send personalized campaign messages to the defined audience segments.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google authentication
- **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand (if used)
- **CSS**: TailwindCSS for styling
- **Backend API**: Communicates with backend APIs built with Node.js and RabbitMQ

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 16.x)
- **npm** (or **yarn**)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/xeno-frontend.git
cd xeno-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Before running the app, you'll need to set up environment variables.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
# Next Auth
AUTH_SECRET=  # Generated by create-t3-app

# Google OAuth Credentials
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=

# Backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080  # The URL for your backend API
```

- **AUTH_GOOGLE_ID** and **AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET**: These are your Google OAuth credentials. Replace them with the credentials you’ve generated from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL**: This is the URL where the frontend will make requests to the backend API. For local development, it is typically `http://localhost:8080`.

### 4. Run the Development Server
After setting up the environment variables, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Testing API Calls with Postman
Use Postman to interact with the backend APIs. Ensure that you have the backend running (either locally or deployed) and the URLs in your `.env.local` file are configured correctly.

### 6. Deployment
To deploy the application, you can use platforms like Vercel or Netlify. Ensure that your environment variables are set up in the platform’s environment variable settings.

## API Documentation
